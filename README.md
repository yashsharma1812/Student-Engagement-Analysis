# Student-Engagement-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on estimating the free-to-paid conversion rate among students who have engaged with video lecture on the platform. Three key metrics have been analyzed: free-to-paid conversion rate, average duration between registration date and first-time engagement, and average duration between first-time engagement and first-time purchase.

The data includes three tables storing information about students’ registration dates, engagement dates, and subscription purchase dates.

## Interpretation of Results
### Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate
The free-to-paid conversion rate is calculated as the percentage of students who purchase a subscription after watching a lecture. A higher conversion rate indicates the effectiveness of the platform in converting engaged students into paying customers. A low conversion rate may require further analysis of the content or the subscription model.

### Average Time to First-Time Engagement
The average duration between registration and first-time engagement provides insights into how quickly students start interacting with the platform. A shorter duration may imply higher engagement and interest. On the other hand, a longer duration might suggest that some students take more time to explore the platform.

### Average Time to First-Time Purchase
The average duration between first-time engagement and first-time purchase indicates the average time it takes for students to convert from engaged users to paying customers. A shorter duration here is generally desirable, as it implies a more efficient conversion process.

## Implications
### Conversion Rate:
- High Conversion Rate: Positive indication of effective monetization strategies or compelling content.
- Low Conversion Rate: May require investigating factors such as pricing, subscription benefits, or content quality.

### Time Metrics:
- Short Time to Engagement: Indicates quick user adoption and interest.
- Long Time to Engagement: May require improvements in onboarding or content discovery.
- Short Time to Purchase: Efficient conversion process.
- Long Time to Purchase: Opportunities for targeted marketing or improving the value proposition.
